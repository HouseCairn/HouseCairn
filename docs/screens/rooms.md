# Rooms

The rooms of a home, at `/h/<home id>/rooms/`. **Rooms** in the navigation
opens it directly (`/rooms/`); with several homes, on the
[current home](my-home.md#the-current-home). Each row shows the name of the room, its type and
how many items it holds; a row opens the [room](room.md).

- **Add a room** opens the [room form](room-form.md). Only the name is
  required.
- **Change the order** shows an up and a down button per room instead of the
  links; **Done** goes back. The order is the one of the list, here and in the
  API.
- The search field looks for a name among the rooms and the items of the
  home: `/h/<home id>/search/?q=<text>`. Rooms and items are listed apart, each
  linking to its page. The search ignores case and looks for the text anywhere
  in the name.

Read-only members see the same list and none of the buttons that change it.

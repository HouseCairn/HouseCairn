# 0064. Every Apprise service with a fixed format, each one reviewed

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-11-12
- Amends: [0043](0043-notifications-through-apprise.md) (the list of schemes)

## Context

ADR 0043 accepted eleven services. People use many more (Microsoft Teams, Rocket.Chat,
Zulip, Pushbullet, Bark, the SMS gateways of their operator), and Apprise 2.1.0, the
version of `uv.lock`, has 171 plugins and 240 schemes. A channel makes the server send a
request to an address a person typed, so a service is only added after reading its plugin:
the method, the host, the path, the format of the body, the headers, and the options of
the address that change the request.

## Decision

**Criteria.** A plugin is admitted when all of these hold, read in its code:

1. It speaks HTTP(S) or SMTP, through `requests` or `smtplib`: nothing that runs a
   program, writes to a local log, drives a device of the server or opens a raw socket.
2. The plugin fixes the method and the format of the body of every request. No option of
   the address chooses the method, the whole path, a header or a field: the generic
   webhooks `json`, `xml` and `form` stay out, and `+name`, `-name` and `:name` stay
   refused for every scheme (ADR 0043). A typed path prefix followed by a fixed path, as
   for Gotify, is accepted.
3. A typed host goes through the guard of ADR 0059: private networks refused unless an
   administrator allows them, loopback, link-local and metadata services always refused,
   every name resolved and every connection checked, no redirect followed.
4. No file of the server is read: a plugin whose options name a file (a key, a template)
   is refused, or its URL is when the option is there (ADR 0043).
5. No image from the network in a message (`include_image` off), and the total delay of a
   send (eight seconds) holds, as for every channel.
6. No Home Assistant token (golden rule 3): `hassio` is refused.
7. No public post: a reminder names a task and a home, which must not end up on a public
   timeline or in a public repository.
8. Where a message goes is said: the screen and the guide say, for each service, whether
   it goes to the server of the person, to the provider in the EU, to the provider in the
   region the address chooses, or to the provider outside the EU (or without saying).

**The list is in the code.** `notifications.catalog` holds every admitted service, with its
family (messaging, push, SMS, email, self-hosted, on-call and alerting), its schemes, an
example address, where its messages go and the page of the Apprise documentation.
`outbound.ALLOWED_SCHEMES` is built from it. The screen of notifications lists it by family.

**Tests.** For each admitted service, its example address is accepted, and a send with the
network intercepted makes its first request with the expected method to the expected host.
The rules of ADR 0043 are checked on each plugin (certificates, delays, no retry, no image),
its address is shown nowhere (screens, export, API), and for each service with a typed host
a private address typed as is, or a name that resolves to one, is refused. Every other
scheme of the installed Apprise is refused, and a test reads the table below: every scheme
of Apprise must be in it, the admitted ones must be the list of the code. A new version of
Apprise with a new plugin fails that test until the plugin is reviewed here.

**The Kodi plugin** keeps the version of its protocol in an attribute named `protocol`: the
check that the scheme parsed is the one typed now reads the schemes of the class.

### Inventory of Apprise 2.1.0

"Requests" gives the methods the plugin uses and whether the host is fixed (the API of the
provider, or one of its regions) or typed (the server of the person, under the guard).
Some services have a fixed host by default and take a typed one in another form of the
address: Microsoft Teams (workflows), Fluxer, Notifico, PushDeer and Better Stack. They are
marked typed here, and those forms go through the guard of ADR 0059 like the others.

## Consequences

- 137 services, 181 schemes, are accepted; 34 plugins, 59 schemes, are refused, each for a reason above.
- A service refused for want of review (Session, Delta Chat) can be admitted by a later
  record, after its review.
- An update of Apprise that adds a plugin, or a scheme to a plugin, fails the tests until
  this table and the list say what to do with it.

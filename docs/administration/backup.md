# Data and backups

Everything HouseCairn writes is in the `/data` volume:

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `/data/db.sqlite3` (and `-wal`, `-shm`) | The SQLite database, unless `DATABASE_URL` points to PostgreSQL. |
| `/data/secret_key` | The key that signs sessions and encrypts the stored secrets, mode 600, generated when `SECRET_KEY` is not set. Losing it signs everyone out and makes the stored secrets unreadable; keep it secret, and apart from the backups (see [The secret key](#the-secret-key)). |
| `/data/media/` | Uploaded files. |
| `/data/backups/` | Copies made by the `backup_instance` and `backup` commands below. |

Files are owned by `10001:10001` and readable by that user only. If you mount a
host directory instead of a named volume, give it to that user first:
`sudo chown -R 10001:10001 /srv/housecairn`.

## Back up

With SQLite, the default, the simplest complete backup, while HouseCairn runs,
is one command ([ADR 0048](../adr/0048-export-format-and-restore.md)):

```sh
docker compose exec housecairn python -m housecairn.entrypoint manage backup_instance
# prints /data/backups/housecairn-<UTC date and time>.tar
```

The archive holds a consistent copy of the database (SQLite's online backup
API, the same as `sqlite3 db.sqlite3 ".backup ..."`), the uploaded files of
`/data/media/`, and `manifest.json` with the SHA-256 digest of each. It is
written with mode 600: it holds every home, keep it as safe as the server. Copy
it off the machine, and remove old copies from `/data/backups/` yourself.
`--output <directory>` writes it elsewhere.

**The secret key is not in the archive**, unless you add `--include-secret-key`.

### The secret key

The stored secrets (the SMTP password, the secrets of the sign-in providers added in the
interface, the addresses of the notification channels) are encrypted in the database with
a key derived from the secret key. An archive that held the key as well would give them
all to whoever got a copy of it, so `backup_instance` leaves it out
([ADR 0060](../adr/0060-secret-key-apart-from-the-backups.md)). Keep the key apart:

- best, set `SECRET_KEY` in `deploy/production.env` (see
  [Secrets](settings.md#secrets)), and keep a copy of that file, or of the key, somewhere
  else than your backups, such as a password manager;
- if the key was generated in `/data/secret_key`, keep a copy of that file the same way.

`--include-secret-key` puts `/data/secret_key` in the archive all the same, for a copy
that must restore alone; it then gives the stored secrets to whoever has it. Without a
key file (the key comes from `SECRET_KEY`), there is nothing to include.

### With PostgreSQL

With PostgreSQL, `backup_instance` calls `pg_dump`, and `restore_instance`
calls `pg_restore`. **The official image contains neither**: in it, both
commands stop with `pg_dump is not installed in this container` (or
`pg_restore`). Back up the two parts separately instead, with the `postgres`
service of `compose.yaml`, whose image has both programs and is of the same
version as the server:

```sh
# 1. The database, in pg_dump's custom format, written on the host.
docker compose --profile postgres exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U housecairn -d housecairn --format=custom > housecairn-db.dump

# 2. The uploaded files, from the volume, read only.
docker run --rm -v housecairn_housecairn-data:/data:ro -v "$PWD":/backup \
  debian:stable-slim tar -cf /backup/housecairn-files.tar -C /data media
```

Keep the secret key apart from these two files, as [above](#the-secret-key). Both
files hold every home; keep them as safe as the server.

These commands follow the `compose.yaml` of the repository (service, user,
database and volume names), but have not yet been tried on a real server: try
a restore on another machine before you rely on them.

Two other ways remain:

- **Cold copy**: stop the container, copy the volume, start it again. The copy
  holds `/data/secret_key` when the key was generated there: keep it as you would
  the key.

  ```sh
  docker compose stop housecairn
  docker run --rm -v housecairn_housecairn-data:/data:ro -v "$PWD":/backup \
    debian:stable-slim tar -czf /backup/housecairn-data.tar.gz -C /data .
  docker compose start housecairn
  ```

  (The volume name is `<project>_housecairn-data`; `docker volume ls` shows it.)

- **The database only**, with `python -m housecairn.entrypoint backup`
  (prints `/data/backups/db-<UTC date and time>.sqlite3`); then copy
  `/data/media/` as well, and keep the key apart.

The owners of a home can also keep their own copy of it: **Export all data**,
which a restore makes a new home again ([Export and deletion](data.md)).

## Restore

With SQLite, stop the application, then restore the archive of
`backup_instance`, and start the application again:

```sh
docker compose run --rm housecairn python -m housecairn.entrypoint manage \
  restore_instance /data/backups/housecairn-20261110T120000Z.tar --yes
```

Every part is checked against the manifest first; a changed backup, a name that
leaves its directory or a link is refused and nothing is replaced. The
database, `/data/media/` and the secret key that were there are not deleted:
they are kept next to it, renamed `<name>.before-restore-<date>`, until you
remove them. Without `--yes`, the command refuses to replace anything.

An archive without the secret key (the default) leaves `/data/secret_key` as it
is, and the command says so. Start the instance with the key it had when the
backup was made: in `SECRET_KEY`, or by putting its `secret_key` file back in
`/data`. With another key the homes, their files and the accounts are all there,
but everyone signs in again and the stored secrets cannot be read: the screens
say so, the SMTP password and the secrets of the sign-in providers are entered
again, and the notification channels are added again.

On a new data directory without `SECRET_KEY`, `manage` generates a key in
`/data/secret_key` before the restore runs. The command then says that this key
was generated just now and is not the one of the backup: replace it with the key
of the instance the backup comes from before you start the instance.

To check a backup without touching the instance, restore it elsewhere:

```sh
python -m housecairn.entrypoint manage restore_instance <backup>.tar \
  --database-file /tmp/check/db.sqlite3 --media-root /tmp/check/media \
  --data-dir /tmp/check
```

For a cold copy, stop the container, put the files back in the volume (owned
by `10001:10001`), and start it.

With PostgreSQL, restore the two parts of [With PostgreSQL](#with-postgresql),
the application stopped and the `postgres` service running:

```sh
docker compose stop housecairn
docker compose --profile postgres exec -T postgres \
  pg_restore -U housecairn -d housecairn --clean --if-exists --no-owner \
  --single-transaction < housecairn-db.dump
docker run --rm -v housecairn_housecairn-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup \
  debian:stable-slim sh -c \
  'tar -xf /backup/housecairn-files.tar -C /data && chown -R 10001:10001 /data'
docker compose start housecairn
```

`--clean --if-exists` drops each table of the dump before it is recreated, so
the database is the one of the dump; `--single-transaction` leaves it as it
was if anything fails. Unlike `restore_instance`, the files are not checked
against a manifest and those already in `/data/media/` are overwritten, not
kept aside. Like the backup, this has not yet been tried on a real server.

# Stock and supplies

The spare parts and supplies of the house: the filter that goes in the ventilation
unit, the tin of paint of the living room, the batteries of the smoke detectors.
This guide shows how to keep track of them. Every field is optional except the name.

## Add a stock item

Open **Rooms** in the navigation, then the **Stock** tab, then **Add a stock item**. Give it a name and, if
you have them at hand, the manufacturer reference, the dimensions, the unit and where
it is kept. A photo of the label saves typing the reference now and finding it again
later: HouseCairn keeps the picture and nothing else (the location and every other
piece of information hidden in the file are removed).

The **unit** comes from a list (piece, litre, metre, kilogram, roll, box) plus **Other**,
where you write your own (bag, pallet). Quantities are then written with it: *1 litre*,
*2 litres*.

Choose the **compatible items** when the part is made for a given piece of
equipment, such as the boiler a filter fits, and the **rooms** where it is used: type in
the field to narrow the list, pick one, and it becomes a chip you can remove. The
links are shown on the page of the stock item, and the page of a room lists the stock
items that concern it (listed on the room, compatible with one of its items, or its
paint left over).

## Count what you have

The quantity is never typed in: it is the sum of the movements. On the page of an
item, enter a quantity and press **Add to stock** after a purchase, **Take from
stock** when you use some, or **Set the count** after counting the shelf, which
corrects the stock to what you counted. A movement is never edited; a mistake is
corrected by another one, so the history always explains the figure.

A **count dated in the past** states what is on the shelf now: its difference is worked
out against the whole stock at the moment you record it, wherever the date puts the line in
the history. The date only places the line.

Set a **threshold** to see which items are running out: they carry a **Low** label,
and **Low stock only** in the list keeps them.

## Let the tasks use the stock

A task lists the stock items it needs, with a quantity, in the **Materials** section of its
form or on its page (see [Tasks and recurrence](tasks-and-recurrence.md)). Marking the task
**Done** takes those quantities from the stock, in one gesture; **Undo** puts them back. The
exits and entries this writes name the task on the page of the stock item. If the stock
holds less than the task needs, **Done** is not refused: the stock goes down to zero and a
message tells how much was missing.

## Give an item a unit price

An item can have a **unit price**: what one unit of it costs, in the currency of the home.
It is optional and never negative. It is not what you paid last time (a supplier keeps its
own last price); it is the price HouseCairn uses to plan the cost of the tasks that use the
item ([Budget](budget.md#the-stock-in-the-cost-of-a-task)). When an item has no unit price
and you give a supplier a last price paid, that price becomes the unit price of the item, once;
correct it in the form of the item if it is not the one you want. A unit price that is already
there is never replaced. An item added from the form of a task has no price until you give
it one on its own page.

An item added from the form of a task is linked to the equipment of that task, when the task
has one: it appears in the **Compatible items** of the item, even when the equipment is added
by the same form.

## Note where to buy

Add one or more suppliers to an item: name, their reference, the purchase link and the
last price paid, in the currency of the home. The link is only a link: HouseCairn
makes no request to it and shows no preview. The search of the list also finds an
item by the name of a supplier.

## Share

Everyone in the home sees the same stock; members and owners change it, read-only
members change nothing. The same data is available to scripts through the
[API](../api/index.md) (`articles`, `suppliers` and `movements`), with the `read` and
`write` scopes of an API token. The stock, the materials of the tasks and what each closing took are part of the
[export of the home](../administration/data.md), label photos included, and is erased
with it.

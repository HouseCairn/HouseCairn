"""The demonstration mode of an instance (`HOUSECAIRN_DEMO`, docs/adr/0071).

A public demonstration instance has two fictional accounts whose addresses and password are
published, and comes back to a known state every night (`reset_demo`). Off by default: with
`HOUSECAIRN_DEMO` false, nothing here changes what the application does.

On, it keeps what a visitor signed in with a public account could otherwise do to the
instance or to the outside world:

- the settings of the instance and its sign-in providers are shown, never changed;
- nothing leaves the server: no email, no notification, no preview of a link, no sign-in
  through a provider;
- no account is created, and the two accounts keep their password, their address, their
  second factors and their existence;
- files are held to small limits, for each file, each home and the whole instance.

Every refusal raises `DemoRefusedError`, a `PermissionDenied`: the web screens turn it
into a message (`demo.middleware`), the API into a 403 with the code `demo`.

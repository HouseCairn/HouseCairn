"""The return rule: one place reads `next`, one place names where it leads.

People come back to the screen they came from, and to the parent in the tree when it
is not known (docs/developer/design-guide.md, "Return rule"; docs/adr/0053). A link
that opens a record or a form carries `next=<current path>`; the page reads it with
`back_url`, the back link and Cancel lead there, and so does the form once sent.

`next` is a parameter anyone can forge in a link. So it is:

- checked by `core.redirects.is_safe_redirect` (a safe shape, then the host);
- a path relative to the application, starting with one `/`;
- never nested: a `next` inside `next` is removed;
- cut to `MAX_LENGTH`: past it the query goes, and past it again the address is refused;
- never shown: the label of a back link comes from the route the path resolves to, and
  a record is named only when it belongs to a home the person may open.

"""Which addresses the server may call, and a guarded fetch for a page a person typed.

Two kinds of caller share this module:

- the addresses a person may point the server at. `forbidden_address` is the rule of the
  test of an identity provider (docs/adr/0041): loopback, link-local, multicast,
  unspecified and reserved addresses are refused and private networks are allowed, since
  an identity provider often runs on the local network. The notifications start from it
  and refuse more (`notifications.outbound.refusal`, docs/adr/0059): the metadata services
  of cloud providers always, and every address that is not global (`is_public`) unless an
  administrator allows private networks. An IPv6 address that carries an IPv4 one is
  judged by the IPv4 address (`embedded_ipv4`);
- the preview of a link (docs/adr/0050), where a person types the address of a page on the
  open web and the server reads it. `is_public` is stricter: only global addresses, so no
  private network, no shared address space and no metadata service of a cloud provider.
  `fetch` applies it to every hop of the request.

`fetch` is built so that the check cannot be got around:

- the name is resolved once per hop and every address it gives must pass; the connection
  goes to an address that passed, never to the name again, so a resolver that answers
  differently the second time (rebinding) is not asked;
- a redirect is followed by the same code, hop after hop, at most `MAX_REDIRECTS` times,
  and only to `http` and `https`; the port must be 80 or 443 on every hop (`PUBLIC_PORTS`),
  so the server cannot be made to speak HTTP to a mail or database service;
- the whole request, name resolution apart, lasts `seconds` at most, however slowly the
  server answers: a watchdog shuts the sockets down at the deadline, so a read that
  blocks gets the end of the stream at once. Nothing outlives the call: the watchdog is
  stopped and joined, and every socket is closed, whatever happened;
- the body is read in pieces and never beyond `max_bytes`; the answer is not decoded or
  decompressed (`Accept-Encoding: identity`), so a small body cannot grow;
- nothing in the answer is run or loaded: the caller gets bytes.

A refusal is a `RefusedError` with a short reason code, never the address or the URL.

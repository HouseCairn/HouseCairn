"""Restoring the archive of a home as a new home (docs/adr/0048).

The archive is read as hostile until proven otherwise, in this order, and nothing is
written before every check has passed:

1. the zip itself (`read_archive`): only the names the format allows, no link, no
   encrypted entry, no duplicate, a cap on the number of entries and on the size once
   unpacked, read from the headers before anything is unpacked, and every entry read
   back no larger than its header says;
2. the manifest: the format and a version this instance knows, and the SHA-256 digest
   and size of every other entry, which must all be listed and all match;
3. each object: every field parsed by its type and checked by the validators of its
   model, every reference to an object that the archive itself holds (never to a row of
   another home), and no identifier already used on this instance;
4. each file: decoded again, its type the one the row says, as at upload.

Then the home, its rows and its files are written in one transaction; a file already
written is removed if anything fails. Identifiers are kept. People are matched by e-mail
address on existing accounts, never created: from the web, only the person restoring is
matched; from `manage.py restore_home`, run by the administrator of the instance, every
person of the archive with an account (docs/adr/0048).

A restore *as a copy* (docs/adr/0069) goes through the same checks, then gives every
object of the archive a new identifier, the links between them following, so that it can
sit next to the home it was made from. Only the person restoring is matched, and is its
only member; when that home is on this instance, only one of its owners may copy it.

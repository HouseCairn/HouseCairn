"""The current home: where a section opens when its address carries no home.

Most households have one home; some have two or more. The home last chosen in the
selector of the app bar, or last opened by a page of a home, is kept in the session, so
that Rooms, Projects, Budget and Today open on it without a page that asks which home
(docs/developer/design-guide.md, "Current home").

A value kept in a session is a preference, never a permission. It is read back only
among the homes the person may open now (`open_homes_for_request`), at every request:
a forged id, a home left or deleted, a home locked behind a sign-in provider is never
returned, and the next home of the person (by name) takes its place. Every page of a home
still takes its home from its address and checks it (`HomeScopedMixin`); this module only
chooses the address a section root opens.

API requests never read nor write it: an API token has no session, and its scope is
the list of homes of the token.

"""The archive of a large home, made by the worker and downloaded later (docs/adr/0048).

Under `HOUSECAIRN_EXPORT_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` of files the archive is made during the
request, as before. Above, the request only records an `ExportJob` and queues
`make_archive`; the owner downloads the archive from the page of the job, signed in,
at most `HOUSECAIRN_EXPORT_DOWNLOADS` times and for `HOUSECAIRN_EXPORT_KEEP_HOURS` hours.
Expired archives are removed every hour by the worker (`PURGE_SCHEDULE`), and also
whenever an export starts or a download is asked for; so is a partial archive (`.part`)
older than that, left by a worker stopped while it wrote it.

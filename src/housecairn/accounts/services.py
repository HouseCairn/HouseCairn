Sign-up through OIDC is closed by default. A sign-in without a matching

- while the instance has never had an account: the first sign-in creates the
  instance administrator (bootstrap), optionally restricted to one verified
  address with `HOUSECAIRN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`;
- when the operator opens sign-up to everyone the provider accepts
  (`HOUSECAIRN_OIDC_SIGNUP=open`);
- when a home has a pending invitation for the address, and the provider
  says the address is verified (`has_invitation`, docs/adr/0020).

Accounts created in the last two cases have no administration rights.

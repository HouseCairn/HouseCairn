"""Links of inspiration of a project, with a preview read once (docs/adr/0050).

A link is an address, a title and, when the page gave one, a picture stored like a photo of
the project. Adding a link saves it at once with its address. Reading the page, which can
take seconds, is a task of the background worker queued just after (docs/adr/0069), and only
if the instance allows it (`link_preview_enabled`, docs/adr/0035): the request never waits
for another server. The worker fills the title (unless the person typed one) and the picture
when it is done. Any failure leaves the plain address: adding a link never fails because a
page could not be read, and a reading that has not ended after `PREVIEW_DEADLINE_SECONDS`
is marked failed, never left "being read".

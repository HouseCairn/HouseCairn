"""No table of the project escapes the export of a home without a written reason (docs/adr/0023).

The registry of `homes.exports` is filled by each app; nothing there stops a lot from adding
a table and forgetting its exporter. These tests go through every model of the project
(`apps.get_models()`, many-to-many tables included) and put each in one of three places:

- exported: the export of a home reads its table;
- left out of the archive on purpose, and erased with the home (`LEFT_OUT`);
- not data of a home at all: of the instance or of a person (`NOT_OF_A_HOME`).

A new table that is in none of them fails, with the name of the table.
